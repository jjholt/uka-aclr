Knee is heavily varus. tibial landmarks were made to parallel to joint line, not tibia.
Getting some external rotation in flexion, which is odd.

After several attempts that looked weird, including instability in loaded passive flexion, the tibial landmarks were changed to be in line with the tibia, not the joint line.
This starts on run 17

Unusual flexion extension gap to address we dropped the femoral cutting guide inferior to reduce the posterior cut on the femur.
