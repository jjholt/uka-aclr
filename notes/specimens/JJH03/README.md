Constitutional varus tibia
--
about 6.5mm anterior translation in passive flexion
7.7mm anterior translation in full extension with 90N anterior before flexing
8.8mm anterior translation in full extension with 90N after extension
---
About 10 deg of flexion in full extension
ACL recon was lateral on the femur, resulting in the ligament rubbing against the condyle in external rotation
In neutral this is no longer an issue.
The ACL footprint on the tibia is incredibly close to the UKA, so it was made a little more lateral as well.
overall reasonable pACLR. We'll see the results

Used 5.5mm hole instead of 5. Should have used a 7mm screw probably.

Frozen after pACLR. If pACLR doesn't survive, redo with 7mm screw.
