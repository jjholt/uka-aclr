Constitutional varus tibia
--
about 6.5mm anterior translation in passive flexion
7.7mm anterior translation in full extension with 90N anterior before flexing
8.8mm anterior translation in full extension with 90N after extension
---
About 10 deg of flexion in full extension
ACL recon was lateral on the femur, resulting in the ligament rubbing against the condyle in external rotation
In neutral this is no longer an issue.
The ACL footprint on the tibia is incredibly close to the UKA, so it was made a little more lateral as well.
overall reasonable pACLR. We'll see the results

Used 5.5mm hole instead of 5. Should have used a 7mm screw probably.

Frozen after pACLR. If pACLR doesn't survive, redo with 7mm screw.

pACL ruptured during anterior loading

Remounting was a little difficult, but theoretically it should be in the same spot. nevertheless, it is externally rotating during flexion after ACLR. The mechanics post ACLR are quite unusual.
Marcus was happy with AP laxity, but it feels a little lax to me. Rotational stability also seems a little more lax

ACL was retensioned for run 27 on the robot. Registered 50N anterior drawer after the tensioning.
Unloaded passive flexion looked mildly different, but loaded anterior drawer looked practically the same.
Lachman registered 6mm anterior laxity before retensioning, and 5mm after. All tests were not re-done.

Consider redoing UKA+ACLR and UKA-ACL redigitising all landmarks, etc

Tibial tray dislocated during testing with no ACL
