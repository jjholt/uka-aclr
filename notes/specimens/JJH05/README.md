10mm posterior translation under 90N posterior force
3mm anterior translation under 90N anterior force
anterior laxity of about 3mm
20deg internal rotation with 5Nm internal.
correlation between IE and AP => high posterior laxity

Hyper extension is about 15-20 deg flexion.
Trajectories were changed to be 0 to 75 deg.
Runs 17 and 18 are UKA+ACL unoptimised.
Seems that we put it in hyper extension. At 45deg you expect to see a switch in sides on the compression (i.e. from +5 to -5 on the targeted 50N). We saw it at about 48deg.
Runs 33 and 34 are UKA+pACLR unoptimised

Under load the anterior translation was 2mm. At 45N anterior, the femoral screw was pulled out.


Runs 39 and 40 are UKA+pACL
After removal ,we could extend the knee another 5 degrees.
Everything was shifted to 0 to 80deg. The optimisation added 7 deg of flexion, so I feel comfortable going back to 0 to 90.

Run 41 is UKA+pACL

Instability in deep flexion resulted in AP forces of about 250N and the ACLR slipped.
