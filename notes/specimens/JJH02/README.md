Some medial OA


Run 7 is optimised, not native!!
10deg internal external arc at 90deg.
max extension is about 15 deg flexion.

pre optimisation, 2.0Nm external => 5.2deg. 2.0Nm internal => 4.5deg ish
at 45 deg, 2Nm => 4.5 deg
at 90 deg, 2Nm => 3.0 deg

Extension loaded remained posterior. 3 => 6 (20deg) => 1.5 (90 deg). 4.5mm total
Applying 90N anterior moved from 4.2 posterior to 0.1 anterior

Expect posterior motion until around 30deg, then anterior up to 4.5mm. Wrong. Stayed around 1mm posterior until 70deg.
at 80deg reached 0, at 90 deg reached -1. Then about 1.5 somewhere along the extension arc.
Indicative of coordinate system being really weird. Expect weird results.

Run failed for some reason on posterior. Reruning starting with posterior.
90N post, 7mm post at extension. would expect around 3mm posterior in flexion. Got 3.5mm posterior.
At full extension with internal rotation torque, it only moved 1 degree.
Once the external rotation torque was applied, it moved 11 degrees. The tightness could be felt prior to study.
Is 11 degrees just compensating for the full IE arc at extension?
Failed on the same position, but between runs 12 and 13 I have full data.
A little weird, but the shapes overall were correct.

Run a second time. Ran into same bug.
