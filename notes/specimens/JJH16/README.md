Unsuccesful native testing. Requires new digitisation.
0.5mm anterior translation under compression in full extension.
4mm anterior translation in flexion under compression
High (?) external rotation. possibly PLC damage?
Posterior translation during flexion? Obviously centre of rotation is wrong. attempted a new optimisation and it was just as bad.
