Loading led to 5.5deg external rotation, 4mm posterior translation
Neutral: +4 in extension, -1.5 in flexion, +4 in extension.
90N ant: +2 in extension, -6 in flexion. last 15deg extension went from -6.5 to -3.
Experienced posterior translation under load coupled with external rotation.
When removed to check, it would not slide back in the same place. Remounted, re-digitised.
After unoptimised passive flexion, some internal rotation + anterior translation on extension
Loading moved the tibia posterior to 4mm.
Posterior load: 6mm posterior in extension
