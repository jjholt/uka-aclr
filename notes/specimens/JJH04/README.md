Approx 10deg internal/external arc at 90 deg flexion
In passive flexion post optimisation, it looks like a straight line between around 30 to 90. Discontinuity?
Worth plotting in native coordinate system to check

2.5mm posterior translation in full extension under load
Up to 4mm anterior at 90deg
Extending places it back to 2.5mm anterior up until 20 deg, then 0.5 posterior in extension.
4.5mm total anterior movement.
Expect to see -6.5 during flexion with 90N anterior: Got -6.4. Excellent.
Lateral & anterior translation + valgus coupled?
Posterior load: started at 7.5ish. Expect to reach 3ish? Got 3.5ish.
valgus slowly going into varus with the posterior load.

Internal rotation, increasing valgus. 1.5 valgus, 10ish internal => 4.4 valgus, 22.5 internal
A little lateral 3mm , a little anterior 2.3mm.

in extension with External rotation, 1 deg valgus, very little of everything else.

Removing the 5Nm external rotation went from 13 external to about 2.5 external

Intact ACL, articular cartilage, no osteophytes

Runs 029 and 030 are pACLR, not ACLR.

Tibial tray loosened after testing without an ACL. Largely anterior, but there's clearly some posterior loosening as well
