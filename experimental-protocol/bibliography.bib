Twenty patients with a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) were examined in a single session each. During the assessment, two physical therapists measured the anterior–posterior translation of the knee using both the KT1000 arthrometer and the Lachman test. One examiner performed a repeated measurement of each test for determination of intra-rater reliability. The examiners were blinded to the findings of their colleague. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to describe the degree of reliability of the measurements. High ICCs were found for the intra-rater reliability and the inter-rater reliability of the Lachman test (ICC = 1.0 and 0.77). For the KT1000 arthrometer both ICCs were clearly lower (ICC = 0.47 and 0.14). The KT1000 arthrometer shows inadequate reliabilities, even when measurements are repeated within a single measurement session. Contrastingly, the Lachman test is a reliable measurement to determine the anterior–posterior laxity of the ACL deficit knee. The results of the present study suggest good within-session intra-rater reliability as well as inter-rater reliability for the Lachman test.},

	abstract = {Background:
The knee joint is prone to injury because of its complexity and weight-bearing function. Anterior cruciate
ligament (ACL) ruptures happen in young and physically active population and can result in instability, meniscal tears, and
articular cartilage damage. The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of Lachman and anterior drawer tests in ACL
injury in compare with arthroscopy.

Methods:
In a descriptive, analytical study from 2009 to 2013, 653 patients who were suspected to have ACL rapture were
entered the study. Statistical analysis was performed by the usage of SPSS 16. Multiple comparison procedures were performed
for comparing data between clinical examination and arthroscopic findings and their relation with age and sex.

Results:
Mean age of patients was 28.3±7.58 years (range from 16 to 68 years). From 428 patients, 41.2\% (175 patients)
were between 26 and 35, 38.8\% (165 ones) between 15 and 25 and 20\% (85 patients) out of 36 years. 414 patients were male
(97.2\%) and 12 were female (2.8\%). Sensitivity of anterior drawer test was 94.4\% and sensitivity of Lachman test was 93.5\%.

Conclusion:
The diagnosis of the ACL injury and the decision to reconstruct ACL could be reliably made with regards to
the anterior drawer and Lachman tests result. The tests did not have privilege to each other. The test accuracy increased
considerably under anesthesia especially in women.},

However, the importance of the medial and lateral structures of the knee can also play a significant role in resisting anterior tibial loads, especially in the event of an ACL injury. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine quantitatively the increase in the in-situ forces in the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and posterolateral structures (PLS) of the knee associated with ACL deficiency. Eight fresh-frozen cadaveric human knees were subjected to a 134-N anterior tibial load at full extension and at 15°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of knee flexion. The resulting 5 degrees of freedom kinematics were measured for the intact and the ACL-deficient knees. A robotic/universal force-moment sensor testing system was used for this purpose, as well as to determine the in-situ force in the MCL and PLS in the intact and ACL-deficient knees. For the intact knee, the in-situ forces in both the MCL and PLS were less than 20N for all five flexion angles tested. But in the ACL-deficient knee, the in-situ forces in the MCL and PLS, respectively, were approximately two and five times as large as those in the intact knee (P, 0.05). The results of this study demonstrate that, although both the MCL and PLS play only a minor role in resisting anterior tibial loads in the intact knee, they become significant after ACL injury.},

	abstract = {In the present study, an image correlation method was used to determine the site-dependent strain in the porcine anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). In particular, the strain of the ACL in the femoral and tibial attachment areas was quantified when the eight knees were subjected to a maximum of 50 N anterior tibial load that was applied using a 6-DOF robotic system. The ACL strains in the anterior, central, and posterior bundles of the medial, middle and lateral layers were determined as a function of the applied anterior load. In addition, the surface of the ACL was observed using a light microscope under no loading condition. Results revealed that the strain in the medial layer of the ACL increased gradually and almost linearly with the increase of anterior load in the midsubstance area. In contrast, the strain in the femoral and tibial attachment areas of the medial layer of the ACL increased rapidly at the beginning of anterior loading and gradually thereafter with significant differences in slope of strain-anterior load curve found in the anterior and posterior bundles. The largest strain in response to 50 N of anterior force was found in the tibial attachment area in medial and middle layers, while the maximum strain was found in the femoral attachment area in the lateral layer. Microscopic observation indicated that crimp structure was more clearly observed in the femoral and tibial attachment areas than in the mid-substance. These microstructural features of the ACL were may be attributable to the higher and load-dependent, nonlinear strain observed in the attachment areas. Our study suggested that the strain in the ACL at full extension is site- and load-dependent in a non-linear manner at the femoral and tibial attachment areas.},

	abstract = {Background: The biomechanical effect of lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) performed in conjunction with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) on load sharing between the ACL graft and the LET and on knee kinematics is not clear.
Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose was to quantify the effect of LET on (1) forces carried by both the ACL graft and the LET and (2) tibiofemoral kinematics in response to simulated pivot shift and anterior laxity tests. We hypothesized that LET would decrease forces carried by the ACL graft and anterior tibial translation (ATT) in response to simulated pivoting maneuvers and during simulated tests of anterior laxity.
Study Design: Controlled laboratory study.
Methods: Seven cadaveric knees (mean age, 39 ± 12 years [range, 28-54 years]; 4 male) were mounted to a robotic manipulator. The robot simulated clinical pivoting maneuvers and tests of anterior laxity: namely, the Lachman and anterior drawer tests. Each knee was assessed in the following states: ACL intact, ACL sectioned, ACL reconstructed (using a bone–patellar tendon–bone autograft), and after performing LET (the modified Lemaire technique after sectioning of the anterolateral ligament and Kaplan fibers). Resultant forces carried by the ACL graft and LET at the peak applied loads were determined via superposition. ATT was determined in response to the applied loads.
Results: With the applied pivoting loads, performing LET decreased ACL graft force up to 80\% (44 ± 12 N; P {\textless} .001) and decreased ATT of the lateral compartment compared with that of the intact knee up to 7.6 ± 2.9 mm (P {\textless} .001). The LET carried up to 91\% of the force generated in the ACL graft during isolated ACLR (without LET). For simulated tests of anterior laxity, performing LET decreased ACL graft force by 70\% (40 ± 20 N; P = .001) for the anterior drawer test with no significant difference detected for the Lachman test. No differences in ATT were deteced between ACLR with LET and the intact knee on both the Lachman and the anterior drawer tests (P = .409). LET reduced ATT compared with isolated ACLR on the simulated anterior drawer test by 2.4 ± 1.8 mm (P = .032) but not on the simulated Lachman test.
Conclusion: In a cadaveric model, LET in combination with ACLR transferred loads from the ACL graft to the LET and reduced ATT with applied pivoting loads and during the simulated anterior drawer test. The effect of LET on ACL graft force and ATT was less pronounced on the simulated Lachman test.
Clinical Relevance: LET in addition to ACLR may be a suitable option to offload the ACL graft and to reduce ATT in the lateral compartment to magnitudes less than that of the intact knee with clinical pivoting maneuvers. In contrast, LET did not offload the ACL graft or add to the anterior restraint provided by the ACL graft during the Lachman test.},

The tissue is externally vibrated over a range of frequencies simultaneously and the resulting displacement is recorded at multiple locations and time instants with a sequence of ultrasound images. Two methods are proposed for estimating the mechanical properties from the recorded data. In the first method, equations of motion are written for a tissue model of masses, springs and dampers. The equations are solved to identify the model parameters and construct an image. The second method performs a transfer function analysis of the tissue motion. The tissue properties are identified from the shape the of transfer function. Simulations show good performance of the new method compared with static elastography. Initial experimental results from homogeneous and layered tissue phantoms also demonstrate the ability quantitatively to image tissue stiffness. Preliminary results are obtained for viscosity and density estimation. Further work is needed to extend the formulation to 3-D and improve robustness of the viscosity and density estimates.

	abstract = {Purpose
The purpose was to clarify the load-bearing functions of the fibers of the femoral anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) attachment in resisting tibial anterior drawer and rotation.
Methods
A sequential cutting study was performed on 8 fresh-frozen human knees. The femoral attachment of the ACL was divided into a central area that had dense fibers inserting directly into the femur and anterior and posterior fan-like extension areas. The ACL fibers were cut sequentially from the bone: the posterior fan-like area in 2 stages, the central dense area in 4 stages, and then the anterior fan-like area in 2 stages. Each knee was mounted in a robotic joint testing system that applied tibial anteroposterior 6-mm translations and 10° or 15° of internal rotation at 0° to 90° of flexion. The reduction of restraining force or moment was measured after each cut.
Results
The central area resisted 82\% to 90\% of the anterior drawer force; the anterior fan-like area, 2\% to 3\%; and the posterior fan-like area, 11\% to 15\%. Among the 4 central areas, most load was carried close to the roof of the intercondylar notch: the anteromedial bundle resisted 66\% to 84\% of the force and the posterolateral bundle resisted 16\% to 9\% from 0° to 90° of flexion. There was no clear pattern for tibial internal rotation, with the load shared among the posterodistal and central areas near extension and mostly the central areas in flexion.
Conclusions
Under the experimental conditions described, 66\% to 84\% of the resistance to tibial anterior drawer arose from the ACL fibers at the central-proximal area of the femoral attachment, corresponding to the anteromedial bundle; the fan-like extension fibers contributed very little. This work did not support moving a single-bundle ACL graft to the side wall of the notch or attempting to cover the whole attachment area if the intention was to mimic how the natural ACL resists tibial displacements.
Clinical Relevance
There is ongoing debate about how best to reconstruct the ACL to restore normal knee function, including where is the best place for ACL graft tunnels. This study found that the most important area on the femur, in terms of resisting displacement of the tibia, was in the central-anterior part of the femoral ACL attachment, near the roof of the intercondylar notch. The testing protocol did not lead to data that would support using a large ACL graft tunnel that attempts to cover the whole natural femoral attachment area.},

	abstract = {Background: Pivot-shift injury commonly results in combined anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)/medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury, yet the contribution of the components of the MCL complex to restraining multiplanar rotatory loads forming critical subcomponents of the pivot shift is not well understood.
Purpose: To quantify the role of the MCL complex in restraining multiplanar rotatory loads.
Study Design: Controlled laboratory study.
Methods: A robotic manipulator was used to apply combined valgus and internal rotation torques in a simplified model of the pivot-shift examination in 12 cadaveric knees (49 ± 11 years). Tibiofemoral kinematics were recorded with the ACL intact. Loads borne by the superficial MCL (sMCL), posterior oblique ligament (POL), deep MCL (dMCL), and ACL were determined via the principle of superposition.
Results: The POL bore about 50\% of the load carried by the ACL in response to the combined torques at 5° and 15° of flexion. The POL bore load during the internal rotation component of the combined torques, while the sMCL carried load during the valgus and internal rotation phases of the simulated pivot. Load in the dMCL was always {\textless}10\% of the ACL in response to combined valgus and internal rotation torques.
Conclusion: The POL provides complementary load bearing to the ACL near extension in response to combined torques, which capture key components of the pivot-shift examination. The sMCL resists the valgus component of the maneuver alone, a loading pattern unique from those of the POL and ACL. The dMCL is not loaded during clinical tests of rotational knee stability in the ACL-competent knee.
Clinical Relevance: Both the sMCL and POL work together with the ACL to resist combined moments, which form key components of the pivot-shift examination.},

	abstract = {Objectives
For a population with knee osteoarthritis (OA), determine: 1) the prevalence of single compartmental, bicompartmental and tricompartmental OA, 2) the prevalence of isolated medial tibiofemoral, lateral tibiofemoral, or patellofemoral OA, and combinations thereof.
Methods
PubMed and Web of Science databases, and reference lists of identified studies, were searched to find studies which reported on the compartmental distribution and prevalence of knee OA. Two independent reviewers assessed studies against pre-defined inclusion criteria and prevalence data were extracted along with subject characteristics. The methodological quality of each included study was assessed. A random-effects model meta-analysis was performed for each OA category to estimate the relative prevalence of OA in the knee compartments amongst people with knee OA.
Results
16 studies (3,786 knees) met the inclusion criteria. High heterogeneity was measured. Normalised for knees with OA, estimated prevalence rates (95\% CI) were: single compartmental 50\% (31.5–58.3\%), bicompartmental 33\% (23.1–37.2\%) and tricompartmental only 17\% (8.8–24.8\%). Isolated medial tibiofemoral OA, isolated patellofemoral OA, and combined medial tibiofemoral and patellofemoral OA were more common than tricompartmental disease, occurring in 27\% (15.2–31.1\%), 18\% (9.9–22.7\%) and 23\% (14.1–27.3\%) of people respectively. Single/bicompartmental patterns of disease involving the lateral tibiofemoral compartment were less common, summing to 15\% (8.5–18.7\%).
Conclusion
Three-quarters of people with knee OA do not have tricompartmental disease. This is not reflected in the frequency with which partial and combined partial knee arthroplasties are currently used.

	abstract = {Background
The purpose of this study was to evaluate early postoperative outcomes in patients following UKA (unicompartmental knee arthroplasty) compared to a matched cohort of TKA (total knee arthroplasty) patients.
Methods
Patients who met radiographic criteria for a medial UKA who underwent either a TKA or UKA at a single institution were matched based on age, gender, and BMI.
Results
One hundredy and fifty UKA in 138 patients and 150 TKA in 148 patients were included in this retrospective analysis. Mean age was 62.6 ± 9 years and 65.2 ± 9 years in the UKA and TKA groups respectively (p = .01). Patients who underwent UKA had significantly less pain at two and six weeks postoperatively compared to TKA patients with mean Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) scores of 3.7 ± 1.1 vs. 7.8 ± 1.2, p {\textless} .001 and 2.6 ± 1.3 vs. 4.6 ± 1.6, p {\textless} .001 respectively. Knee Society Scores (KSS) were higher in the UKA group at six weeks and two years postoperative (86.5 ± 2.8 vs. 81.4 ± 3.6, p {\textless} .001 and 89.5 ± 2.4 vs. 84.5 ± 3.3, p {\textless} .001 respectively). Return to work was faster in the UKA group (mean 20.6 ± 7.89 vs. 38.6 ± 6.23 days, p {\textless} .001). The UKA group also had higher mean Forgotten Joint Scores of 90.5 ± 3.6 vs. 79.5 ± 9.5 (p {\textless} .001).
Conclusions
Patients with primarily medial compartment OA who underwent UKA had less postoperative pain, earlier return to work, and higher KSS compared to a matched group who underwent TKA.},

	abstract = {Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) has regained popularity in recent years. However, limited data exist on how UKA affects knee biomechanics. The role of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) after fixed bearing UKA remains controversial. In this study, a robotic testing system was used to apply a quadriceps/hamstrings load to cadaveric knee specimens in the intact state, after medial UKA, and after transection of the ACL in UKA. The load was applied to the knee from full extension to 120° of flexion in 30° increments. UKA generally did not affect anterior–posterior (AP) femoral position, but did cause external tibial rotation and variations in varus–valgus rotation compared to the intact knee. ACL transection after UKA shifted the femur posteriorly compared to the intact and UKA knees and increased internal tibial rotation compared to the UKA knee at low flexion. The AP motion of the articular contact position in the implant was increased after ACL transection. These data might help explain the mechanism of tibial component loosening and provide insight into further investigations of polyethylene wear in UKA. Based on the kinematic data, the ACL should be functional to provide patients the greatest opportunity for long-term success after medial UKA. © 2006 Orthopaedic Research Society.

	abstract = {The incidence of meniscal tears in the chronically anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee is increased, particularly in the medial meniscus because it performs an important function in limiting knee motion. We evaluated the role of the medial meniscus in stabilizing the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee and hypothesized that the resultant force in the meniscus is significantly elevated in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee. To test this hypothesis, we employed a robotic/universal force-moment sensor testing system to determine the increase in the resultant force in the human medial meniscus in response to an anterior tibial load following transection of the anterior cruciate ligament. We also measured changes in the kinematics of the knee in multiple degrees of freedom following medial meniscectomy in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee. In response to a 134-N anterior tibial load, the resultant force in the medial meniscus of the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee increased significantly compared with that in the meniscus of the intact knee; it increased by a minimum of 10.1 N (52\%) at full knee extension to a maximum of 50.2 N (197\%) at 60 degrees of flexion. Medial meniscectomy in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee also caused a significant increase in anterior tibial translation in response to the anterior tibial load, ranging from an increase of 2.2 mm at full knee extension to 5.8 mm at 60 degrees of flexion. Conversely, coupled internal tibial rotation in response to the load decreased significantly, ranging from a decrease of 2.5 degrees at 15 degrees of knee flexion to 4.7 degrees at 60 degrees of flexion. Our data confirm the hypothesis that the resultant force in the medial meniscus is significantly greater in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee than in the intact knee when the knee is subjected to anterior tibial loads. This indicates that the demand on the medial meniscus in resisting anterior tibial loads is increased in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee compared with in the intact knee, suggesting a mechanism for the increased incidence of medial meniscal tears observed in chronically anterior cruciate ligament-deficient patients. The large changes in kinematics due to medial meniscectomy in the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee confirm the important role of the medial meniscus in controlling knee stability. These findings suggest that the reduction of resultant force in the meniscus may be a further motive for reconstructing the anterior cruciate ligament, with the goal of preserving meniscal integrity.},

Hypothesis: Anatomic two-bundle reconstruction restores knee kinematics more closely to normal than does single-bundle reconstruction.
Study Design: Controlled laboratory study.
Methods: Ten cadaveric knees were subjected to external loading conditions: 1) a 134-N anterior tibial load and 2) a combined rotatory load of 5-N·m internal tibial torque and 10-N·m valgus torque. Resulting knee kinematics and in situ force in the anterior cruciate ligament or replacement graft were determined by using a robotic/universal force-moment sensor testing system for 1) intact, 2) anterior cruciate ligament deficient, 3) single-bundle reconstructed, and 4) anatomically reconstructed knees.
Results: Anterior tibial translation for the anatomic reconstruction was significantly closer to that of the intact knee than was the single-bundle reconstruction. The in situ force normalized to the intact anterior cruciate ligament for the anatomic reconstruction was 97\% ± 9\%, whereas the single-bundle reconstruction was only 89\% ± 13\%. With a combined rotatory load, the normalized in situ force for the single-bundle and anatomic reconstructions at 30° of flexion was 66\% ± 40\% and 91\% ± 35\%, respectively.
Conclusions: Anatomic reconstruction may produce a better biomechanical outcome, especially during rotatory loads.

	abstract = {Bi-cruciate retaining total knee arthroplasty (BCR TKA) is thought to result in more natural knee kinematics compared to conventional TKA designs. This may lead to a reduction in dissatisfied patients after TKA. An intact anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a prerequisite for implantation of a BCR TKA but the frequency of an intact ACL in patients indicated for TKA is not well known. The objective of this systematic literature review was to determine the presence of an intact ACL in patients undergoing TKA by intraoperative macroscopic or MRI assessment. A systematic literature review was conducted using PubMed™ and EMBASE™ in June 2020. The ACL of patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) undergoing TKA was classified as present (including intact and degenerated) vs. absent, and as intact vs. not fully intact. Proportional meta-analyses were performed. 2840 articles were identified and screened. 135 full texts were analyzed and 18 studies met the inclusion criteria for subsequent qualitative and quantitative meta-analysis. Analysis of the status of the ACL when assessed intraoperatively during TKA showed that the ligament was present in 79.4\% of patients (CI: 73.5–84.3\%), from 14 studies with 2067 cases studied. The ACL was determined to be intact in 55.0\% of patients (CI: 45.3–64.4\%), from 14 studies with 1916 cases. Preoperative ACL assessment using MRI (2 studies) revealed it was present in 82.9\% of 193 cases (CI: 76.9–87.6\%), and intact in 56.8\% of 176 cases (CI: 8.2–94.7\%). This systematic literature review shows that the ACL is macroscopically intact in more than half of patients with knee OA undergoing TKA, based on intraoperative assessment of the ligament. The results suggest BCR TKA may be considered as an alternative to traditional TKA in a large number of TKA patients. More high-quality studies are needed to better understand the functional status of the ACL in TKA patients.},

	abstract = {Background 
          TKA with retention of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) may improve kinematics and function. However, conflicting reports exist concerning the prevalence of intact ACLs at the time of TKA.
          Questions/purposes 
          Therefore, we asked: (1) what was the ACL status at TKA; (2) what was the sensitivity and specificity of the Lachman test; (3) did MRI ACL integrity correlate with intraoperative observation; (4) did MRI tibial wear patterns correlate with ACL integrity; and (5) did ACL status depend on age or sex?
          Methods 
          We evaluated 200 patients for ACL integrity at the time of TKA. All patients underwent a Lachman test under anesthesia. Intraoperatively, the ACL was characterized as intact, frayed, disrupted, or absent. In 100 patients, MRIs were performed, from which the ACL was graded as intact, indeterminate, or disrupted, and the AP location of tibial wear was categorized.
          Results 
          The ACL was intact in 155 patients (78\%). The Lachman test alone had poor diagnostic ability. The MRI predicted a tear, but we observed two ACLs with indeterminate status that were disrupted. All knees with anterior wear on the medial tibial condyle had an intact ACL (n = 45), and all knees with posterior wear on the medial tibial condyle had a disrupted ACL (n = 8).
          Conclusions 
          Although the Lachman test alone had poor sensitivity, when combined with MRI they together provide a sensitivity of 93.3\% and specificity of 99\%, which we believe makes these reasonable tests for assessing ACL status in the arthritic knee.},

	abstract = {This study looks at the difference between the macroscopic and microscopic appearances of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in a sample of 55 consecutive patients admitted for routine total knee replacement for osteoarthritis. At the time of surgery the macroscopic appearance of the ACL was classified as normal, moderately damaged (fissured) or completely ruptured. The excised ACL was sent for histological examination and grading. The macroscopic appearance of the ACL at surgery was compared to the severity of disease on microscopic examination. At surgery, 31 ACLs were found to be macroscopically normal: 22 of these (71\%) showed moderate to severe disease on microscopic assessment. Thus a macroscopically normal ACL does not necessarily imply histological integrity. This has clinical implications in other areas of knee surgery including Unicompartmental Knee Replacement which require a fully functional intact ACL.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of hamstrings and quadriceps muscle loads on knee kinematics and in situ forces in the posterior cruciate ligament of the knee and to evaluate how the effects of these muscle loads change with knee flexion. Nine human cadaveric knees were studied with a robotic manipulator/universal force-moment sensor testing system. The knees were subjected to an isolated hamstrings load (40 N to both the biceps and the semimembranosus), a combined hamstrings and quadriceps load (the hamstrings load and a 200-N quadriceps load), and an isolated quadriceps load of 200 N. Each load was applied with the knee at full extension and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 degrees of flexion. Without muscle loads, in situ forces in the posterior cruciate ligament were small, ranging from 6+/-5 N at 30 degrees of flexion to 15+/-3 N at 90 degrees. Under an isolated hamstrings load, the in situ force in the posterior cruciate ligament increased significantly throughout all angles of knee flexion, from 13+/-6 N at full extension to 86+/-19 N at 90 degrees. A posterior tibial translation ranging from 1.3+/-0.6 to 2.5+/-0.5 mm was also observed from full extension to 30 degrees of flexion under the hamstrings load. With a combined hamstrings and quadriceps load, tibial translation was 2.2+/-0.7 mm posteriorly at 120 degrees of flexion ut was as high as 4.6+/-1.7 mm anteriorly at 30 degrees. The in situ force in the posterior cruciate ligament decreased significantly under this loading condition compared with under an isolated hamstrings load, ranging from 6+/-7 to 58+/-13 N from 30 to 120 degrees of flexion. With an isolated quadriceps load of 200 N, the in situ forces in the posterior cruciate ligament ranged from 4+/-3 N at 60 degrees of flexion to 34+/-12 N at 120 degrees. Our findings support the notion that, compared with an isolated hamstrings load, combined hamstrings and quadriceps loads significantly reduce the in situ force in the posterior cruciate ligament. These data are in direct contrast to those for the anterior cruciate ligament. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the effects of muscle loads depend significantly on the angle of knee flexion.},
